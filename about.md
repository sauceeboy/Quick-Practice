# Quick Practice

A simple mod that adds a <cg>practice mode</c> button to the ouside of levels, there are 2 settings.

## <cr>Auto Practice</c>
- Removes the <cg>practice mode</c> button alltogether and automaticlly puts the player in <cg>practice mode</c> on enter.

## <co>Layout</c>
- Small Practice: Makes the <cg>practice mode</c> button small and the <cy>play</c> button normal size.
- Same Size: Makes the <cg>practice mode</c> button and the <cy>play</c> button the same size (in my opinion the other option looks better).

Thank you for dowloading my mod, updates will be soon to come!

# Quick Practice

Customize your Geometry Dash experience by adding a <cg>Practice Mode</c> button directly to the Level Info menu and Edit Level Menu.

## Settings

### <cr>Auto Practice</c>
Enable this to bypass the menu entirely. When enabled, the button is hidden, and entering a level will **automatically** start you in <cg>Practice Mode</c>.

### <co>Layout</c>
Customize how the buttons appear in the menu:
- **Small Practice Left:** Adds a compact <cg>Practice</c> button on the left, while keeping the <cy>Play</c> button at its normal size.
- **Small Practice Right** Adds a compact <cg>Practice</c> button on the right, while keeping the <cy>Play</c> button at its normal size.
- **Same Size:** Resizes both the <cy>Play</c> and <cg>Practice</c> buttons to share equal space.
